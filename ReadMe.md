# NAMRUTH S  
Embedded Systems Architect | Robotics Engineer | Autonomous Systems Developer  

## Profile

I design and build intelligent embedded platforms that integrate hardware architecture, real-time control, sensing systems, and edge-level computation.

My work focuses on robotics, autonomous mobility, and high-reliability IoT systems. I engineer for determinism, scalability, and measurable performance.

Currently pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECM) at REVA University with extensive hands-on development in control systems, robotics, and embedded architectures.
